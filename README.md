CBKContacts is an attempt to create a contacts framework that is API compatible with the Contacts.framework that will be released as a part of iOS 9. It uses AddressBook under the hood.  Additionally, CBKContacts fully replaces Contacts.framework on iOS 8.x.  You can still reference CN* classes just as you normally would in Xcode.  At runtime these are replaced by the CBK* equivalents.  

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

CBKContacts is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby

```
